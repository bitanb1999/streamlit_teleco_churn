# Streamlit-Deployment-Churn-Prediction
Churn has two main divisions: voluntary churn and involuntary churn. As you may expect, involuntary churn signifies the loss of a customer due to forces beyond the company’s control (such as death or natural disasters). Voluntary churn is of the greatest interest to businesses because they can control the factors of influence. But churn doesn’t only refer to a customer’s decision to take their business elsewhere. It also entails a subset known as partial churn, which describes customers who downgrade their services, fall behind on their bills, and generally become less profitable customers.

Past churn models have shown that customers rarely leave because of one singular event. More often their disenchantment with an organization grows over time due to a buildup of unsatisfying and frustrating events. By the time a competing offer comes around, customers have been ready to jump ship for some time.

Predicitng the churnability of a customer is essentially a classification model where the various associated metrics are evaluated to estimate the churnability of a customer. For further detailed understanding, data scientists refer to ROC_AUC curves and Bayes' classification methods for calibrated results.
